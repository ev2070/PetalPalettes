## About

In **Petal Palettes**, you’ll find a vibrant landscape filled with flowers. As you move your mouse, one flower will randomly change the colors of its petals, while the other flowers will adapt their colors based on your mouse position relative to the background. This interaction encourages exploration and creativity in discovering various color combinations.

I created this project to provide users with a fun way to explore color palettes and to help them utilize these colors effectively by displaying the corresponding RGB values and hex codes when they click on a flower.

This project has been designed to be responsive, allowing users to edit the room size without compromising functionality. Whether you choose a larger or smaller canvas, the interactive elements will adjust seamlessly to fit the new dimensions.

Enjoy your journey through color and let your creativity bloom!
